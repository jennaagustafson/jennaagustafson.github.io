    "text": "Within the world of golf, greatness has been up for debate for years.\nWhen bantering in a popular discussion of who is the greatest golfer of all time, it is apparent one player stands out compared to everyone else: Tiger Woods. Metrics can display clear evidence of dominant performances that can help lay the argument to rest from the statistical standpoint. While some stats are impressive, others prove to be untouchable.\nTo conceptualize how ahead Tiger is compared to other previously or currently ranked No. 1 players on a table, Wikipedia pulled data from the Official World Golf Rankings (OWGR) of golfers and their weeks at the top. Another table from Wikipedia also looked at each of the four majors’ archived statistics of previous winners.\nCombining both of those together, it’s apparent how far ahead Tiger was in the peak of his career. The players listed are players that were No. 1 after 1997 which was the year when Tiger first touched the top.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nweeks &lt;- read_csv(\"worldnumberonegolfers.csv\") |&gt; \n  separate(player, into=c(\"player\", \"dontknow\"), sep=\"\\\\(\") |&gt; \n  mutate(player = str_trim(player)) |&gt; \n  mutate(totalweeks = gsub(\"(record)\", \"\", totalweeks, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(totalweeks = gsub(\"[a]\", \"\", totalweeks, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;   \n  group_by(player) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    total_career_weeks = sum(as.numeric(totalweeks))\n  ) \n\n\nmajors &lt;- read_csv(\"majors.csv\") |&gt; mutate(player = gsub(\"*\", \"\", player, fixed=TRUE))\n\n\n\nmajorandweek &lt;- weeks |&gt; inner_join(majors)\n\n\ngolfer &lt;- c(\"Adam Scott\", \"Brooks Koepka\", \"David Duval\", \"Dustin Johnson\", \"Ernie Els\", \"Jason Day\", \"Jon Rahm\", \"Jordan Spieth\", \"Justin Rose\", \"Justin Thomas\", \"Jordan Kaymer\", \"Rory McIlroy\", \"Scottie Scheffler\", \"Tiger Woods\", \"Vijay Singh\" )\n\nnewmajorandweek &lt;- majorandweek |&gt;\n  filter(player %in% golfer)|&gt;\n  select(player, total_career_weeks, total_major_wins) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_career_weeks)) |&gt;\n  mutate_at(vars(-player), as.numeric)\n  \n\nnewmajorandweek |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    player = \"Player\",\n    total_career_weeks = \"Weeks at No. 1\",\n    total_major_wins = \"Total Major Titles\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Tiger Woods' Dominance by the Numbers\",\n    subtitle = \"Tiger Woods has nearly tripled the second highest amount of weeks as a No. 1 Golfer.\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Jenna Gustafson | **Source:** Official World Golf Ranking\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=10)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt;\n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#18453B\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = player == \"Tiger Woods\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiger Woods' Dominance by the Numbers\n\n\nTiger Woods has nearly tripled the second highest amount of weeks as a No. 1 Golfer.\n\n\nPlayer\nWeeks at No. 1\nTotal Major Titles\n\n\n\n\nTiger Woods\n2511\n15\n\n\nDustin Johnson\n668\n2\n\n\nRory McIlroy\n562\n4\n\n\nScottie Scheffler\n230\n2\n\n\nJon Rahm\n154\n2\n\n\nVijay Singh\n87\n3\n\n\nBrooks Koepka\n61\n5\n\n\nJason Day\n56\n1\n\n\nJordan Spieth\n37\n3\n\n\nJustin Rose\n34\n1\n\n\nDavid Duval\n29\n1\n\n\nErnie Els\n15\n4\n\n\nAdam Scott\n11\n1\n\n\nJustin Thomas\n9\n2\n\n\n\nBy: Jenna Gustafson | Source: Official World Golf Ranking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiger’s reign was not only explosive, but it was extremely consistent. His performances give data-driven evidence that his accomplishments will be hard to bypass.\nIf reading the numbers didn’t fully capture how ahead Tiger is, then a visual most likely can. Transforming the table into a patchwork chart will clearly show the scale of dominance.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(gt)\n\ngolfer &lt;- c(\"Adam Scott\", \"Brooks Koepka\", \"David Duval\", \"Dustin Johnson\", \"Ernie Els\", \"Jason Day\", \"Jon Rahm\", \"Jordan Spieth\", \"Justin Rose\", \"Justin Thomas\", \"Jordan Kaymer\", \"Rory McIlroy\", \"Scottie Scheffler\", \"Tiger Woods\", \"Vijay Singh\" )\n\n newweeks &lt;- weeks |&gt;\n  filter(player %in% golfer) \n  \n newmajors &lt;- majors |&gt;\n   filter(player %in% golfer) |&gt;\n   select(player, total_major_wins)\n \n tigerweeks &lt;- newweeks|&gt;\n   filter(player == \"Tiger Woods\")\n \n tigermajors &lt;- newmajors |&gt;\n   filter(player == \"Tiger Woods\")\n\n\nweekbar&lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=newweeks, aes(x=reorder(player, total_career_weeks), weight= total_career_weeks), fill = \"lightgrey\") +\n geom_bar(data=tigerweeks, aes(x=reorder(player, total_career_weeks), weight= total_career_weeks), fill = \"#18453B\") +\n   coord_flip()+\n  labs( \n    x= \"\",\n    y= \"Total Weeks at No. 1\") +\n  theme_minimal() \n\n\nmajorbar &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=newmajors, aes(x=reorder(player, total_major_wins), weight = total_major_wins), fill = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=tigermajors, aes(x=reorder(player, total_major_wins), weight = total_major_wins), fill=\"#18453B\") +\n  coord_flip()+\n   labs( \n    x= \"\",\n    y= \"Total Major Titles\") +\n  theme_minimal() \n\n\nweekbar + majorbar +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Tiger Woods' Dominance Through Visuals\",\n   subtitle = \"Reference just how far ahead Tiger is vs. everyone else. \",\n    caption = \"Source: Official World Golf Ranking | By: Jenna Gustafson\"\n  ) &\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“But younger players like Scottie Scheffler haven’t been playing golf as long as Tiger Woods.”\nScheffler should undeniably be credited for his outstanding performances because he’s bringing an intense level of talent and success to the game of golf at as he is younger in in his career. Scheffler’s game may be “hot” right now, but that isn’t comparable to the consistency Tiger had.\nSince comparing career accomplishments is unfair because every golfer is at a different stage in their career, it is important to look at the level of success each player has had in their careers so far through their winning percentages. It levels the playing field since not every player has played the same amount of tournaments.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(gt)\n\n\n\ntiger &lt;- c(\"Win Percentage\"= 22, \"Non-Win Percentage\" = 78)\nscottiescheffler &lt;- c(\"Win Percentage\"= 10, \"Non-Win Percentage\" = 90)\nrorymcilroy &lt;- c(\"Win Percentage\"= 11, \"Non-Win Percentage\" = 89)\njordanspieth &lt;- c(\"Win Percentage\"= 5, \"Non-Win Percentage\" = 95)\njasonday &lt;- c(\"Win Percentage\"= 4, \"Non-Win Percentage\" = 96)\nadamscott &lt;- c(\"Win Percentage\"= 3, \"Non-Win Percentage\" = 97)\n \n\n\niron(\nwaffle(\n  tiger,\n  rows = 5,\n  colors = c(\"#18453B\", \"lightgrey\")\n) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Players' Win Percentage\",\n    subtitle = \"Tiger unsurprisingly doubles the second highest winning percentage which is Rory McIlroy's.\",\n    x = \"Tiger Woods\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\")\n    ),\nwaffle(\n  jordanspieth,\n  rows = 5,\n  colors = c(\"#18453B\", \"lightgrey\")\n) +\nlabs(\n  x= \"Jordan Spieth\"\n),\nwaffle(\n  scottiescheffler,\n  rows = 5,\n  colors = c(\"#18453B\", \"lightgrey\")\n) +\nlabs(\n  x= \"Scottie Scheffler\"\n),\nwaffle(\n  rorymcilroy,\n  rows = 5,\n  colors = c(\"#18453B\", \"lightgrey\")\n) +\n labs(\n  x= \"Rory McIlroy\"\n),\nwaffle(\n  adamscott,\n  rows = 5,\n  title = \"\",\n  xlab = \"\",\n  colors = c(\"#18453B\", \"lightgrey\")\n) +\nlabs(\n    x = \"Adam Scott\\n 1 square = 1 percent\",\n    caption=\"Source: PGA | Graphic by: Jenna Gustafson\"\n    )) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile statistically it is easier to crown Tiger as the greatest of all time, there will always be the argument that players like Arnold Palmer or Jack Nicklaus are in the running for that title. Metrics are limited because technology at that time was extremely limited. Even though Nicklaus leads for the most accumulated major wins with 18 total, Tiger Woods is one of six players who has achieved a career grand slam. In fact, Tiger is the first and only player who has achieved “The Tiger Slam”, which is winning four consecutive majors in a row.\nWhile players at the top are displaying a level of greatness that Tiger once had, the standard set by Tiger is not only about reaching the top, but also how long you can sustain your time there."
