    "text": "Within the world of golf, greatness has been debated for years. Statistics can help aid arguments – like looking at ranks and wins. While some stats are impressive, others prove to be untouchable.\nWhen asking the burning question of who is the greatest of all time and taking a look at the metrics of the game, it is apparent one player is in his own league: Tiger Woods.\nNumbers can display clear evidence of dominating performances that can help lay the argument to rest. Players such as Rory McIlroy have accumulated a large number of weeks as No. 1. But some players had a hard time maintaining being at the top like Adam Scott.\nTo conceptualize how ahead Tiger is compared to other previously or currently ranked No. 1 players on a table, Wikipedia pulled data from the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) of golfers and their weeks at the top. Another table from Wikipedia also looked at each of the four majors’ archived stats of previous winners.\nThe table shown is combining both of those together and is able to show how ahead Tiger was in his victory and time of reign. The players included are players that were No. 1 after Tiger’s first week of of brushing the top spot.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nweeks &lt;- read_csv(\"worldnumberonegolfers.csv\") |&gt; \n  separate(player, into=c(\"player\", \"dontknow\"), sep=\"\\\\(\") |&gt; \n  mutate(player = str_trim(player)) |&gt; \n  mutate(totalweeks = gsub(\"(record)\", \"\", totalweeks, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(totalweeks = gsub(\"[a]\", \"\", totalweeks, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;   \n  group_by(player) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    total_career_weeks = sum(as.numeric(totalweeks))\n  ) \n\n\nmajors &lt;- read_csv(\"majors.csv\") |&gt; mutate(player = gsub(\"*\", \"\", player, fixed=TRUE))\n\n\n\nmajorandweek &lt;- weeks |&gt; inner_join(majors)\n\n\ngolfer &lt;- c(\"Adam Scott\", \"Brooks Koepka\", \"David Duval\", \"Dustin Johnson\", \"Ernie Els\", \"Jason Day\", \"Jon Rahm\", \"Jordan Spieth\", \"Justin Rose\", \"Justin Thomas\", \"Jordan Kaymer\", \"Rory McIlroy\", \"Scottie Scheffler\", \"Tiger Woods\", \"Vijay Singh\" )\n\nnewmajorandweek &lt;- majorandweek |&gt;\n  filter(player %in% golfer)|&gt;\n  select(player, total_career_weeks, total_major_wins) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_career_weeks)) |&gt;\n  mutate_at(vars(-player), as.numeric)\n  \n\nnewmajorandweek |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    player = \"Player\",\n    total_career_weeks = \"Weeks at No. 1\",\n    total_major_wins = \"Total Major Titles\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Tiger's Dominance by the Numbers\",\n    subtitle = \"Tiger Woods has nearly tripled the second highest amount of weeks as a No. 1 Golfer.\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Jenna Gustafson | **Source:** Official World Golf Ranking\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=10)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt;\n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#18453B\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = player == \"Tiger Woods\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"lightgrey\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = player == \"Rory McIlroy\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"lightgrey\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = player == \"Adam Scott\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiger's Dominance by the Numbers\n\n\nTiger Woods has nearly tripled the second highest amount of weeks as a No. 1 Golfer.\n\n\nPlayer\nWeeks at No. 1\nTotal Major Titles\n\n\n\n\nTiger Woods\n2511\n15\n\n\nDustin Johnson\n668\n2\n\n\nRory McIlroy\n562\n4\n\n\nScottie Scheffler\n230\n2\n\n\nJon Rahm\n154\n2\n\n\nVijay Singh\n87\n3\n\n\nBrooks Koepka\n61\n5\n\n\nJason Day\n56\n1\n\n\nJordan Spieth\n37\n3\n\n\nJustin Rose\n34\n1\n\n\nDavid Duval\n29\n1\n\n\nErnie Els\n15\n4\n\n\nAdam Scott\n11\n1\n\n\nJustin Thomas\n9\n2\n\n\n\nBy: Jenna Gustafson | Source: Official World Golf Ranking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiger’s reign was not only explosive, but it was consistent and sustained.
