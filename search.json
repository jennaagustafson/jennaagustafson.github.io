    "text": "Within the world of golf, greatness has been up for debate for years.\nWhen bantering in a popular discussion of who is the greatest golfer of all time, it is apparent one player stands out compared to everyone else: Tiger Woods. Metrics can display clear evidence of dominating performances that can help lay the argument to rest from the statistical standpoint. While some stats are impressive, others prove to be untouchable.\nTo conceptualize how ahead Tiger is compared to other previously or currently ranked No. 1 players on a table, Wikipedia pulled data from the Official World Golf Rankings (OWGR) of golfers and their weeks at the top. Another table from Wikipedia also looked at each of the four majors’ archived statistics of previous winners.\nCombining both of those together, it’s apparent how far ahead Tiger was in the peak of his career. The players listed are players that were No. 1 after 1997 which was the year when Tiger first touched the top.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nweeks &lt;- read_csv(\"worldnumberonegolfers.csv\") |&gt; \n  separate(player, into=c(\"player\", \"dontknow\"), sep=\"\\\\(\") |&gt; \n  mutate(player = str_trim(player)) |&gt; \n  mutate(totalweeks = gsub(\"(record)\", \"\", totalweeks, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(totalweeks = gsub(\"[a]\", \"\", totalweeks, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;   \n  group_by(player) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    total_career_weeks = sum(as.numeric(totalweeks))\n  ) \n\n\nmajors &lt;- read_csv(\"majors.csv\") |&gt; mutate(player = gsub(\"*\", \"\", player, fixed=TRUE))\n\n\n\nmajorandweek &lt;- weeks |&gt; inner_join(majors)\n\n\ngolfer &lt;- c(\"Adam Scott\", \"Brooks Koepka\", \"David Duval\", \"Dustin Johnson\", \"Ernie Els\", \"Jason Day\", \"Jon Rahm\", \"Jordan Spieth\", \"Justin Rose\", \"Justin Thomas\", \"Jordan Kaymer\", \"Rory McIlroy\", \"Scottie Scheffler\", \"Tiger Woods\", \"Vijay Singh\" )\n\nnewmajorandweek &lt;- majorandweek |&gt;\n  filter(player %in% golfer)|&gt;\n  select(player, total_career_weeks, total_major_wins) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_career_weeks)) |&gt;\n  mutate_at(vars(-player), as.numeric)\n  \n\nnewmajorandweek |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    player = \"Player\",\n    total_career_weeks = \"Weeks at No. 1\",\n    total_major_wins = \"Total Major Titles\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Tiger's Dominance by the Numbers\",\n    subtitle = \"Tiger Woods has nearly tripled the second highest amount of weeks as a No. 1 Golfer.\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Jenna Gustafson | **Source:** Official World Golf Ranking\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=10)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt;\n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#18453B\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = player == \"Tiger Woods\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiger's Dominance by the Numbers\n\n\nTiger Woods has nearly tripled the second highest amount of weeks as a No. 1 Golfer.\n\n\nPlayer\nWeeks at No. 1\nTotal Major Titles\n\n\n\n\nTiger Woods\n2511\n15\n\n\nDustin Johnson\n668\n2\n\n\nRory McIlroy\n562\n4\n\n\nScottie Scheffler\n230\n2\n\n\nJon Rahm\n154\n2\n\n\nVijay Singh\n87\n3\n\n\nBrooks Koepka\n61\n5\n\n\nJason Day\n56\n1\n\n\nJordan Spieth\n37\n3\n\n\nJustin Rose\n34\n1\n\n\nDavid Duval\n29\n1\n\n\nErnie Els\n15\n4\n\n\nAdam Scott\n11\n1\n\n\nJustin Thomas\n9\n2\n\n\n\nBy: Jenna Gustafson | Source: Official World Golf Ranking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiger’s reign was not only explosive, but it was extremely consistent.
